### Consent for Research Participation

**Research Study Title:** Investigating Middle Eastern Immigrants' Experiences with Computer Security

#### Researchers
- **John Sadik**, University of Tennessee, Knoxville
- **Warda Usman**, Brigham Young University
- **Scott Ruoti**, University of Tennessee, Knoxville
- **Daniel Zappala**, Brigham Young University

#### Why am I being asked to be in this research study?
We are asking you to participate in this research study because you are at least 18 years old and fall into one of the following groups:
- You emigrated from Pakistan to the US with a child who was 13 years old or under.
- You emigrated from Pakistan to the US and then had a child in the US who is now at least 13 years old.
- You emigrated from Pakistan to the US with your parents when you were 13 years old or under.
- Your parents emigrated from Pakistan to the US and you were born in the US.

#### What is this research study about?
The purpose of this research study is to better understand Pakistani immigrants' experiences adjusting to computer security practices in the US. We are particularly interested in learning how to make technology better and more easily usable for immigrants based on their existing practices and norms.

#### Who is conducting this research study?
This study is being conducted by researchers at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, and Brigham Young University.

#### How long will I be in the research study?
- **For individual participants:** If you agree to be in the study, your participation will last for approximately 45 minutes.
- **For parent-child pairs:** Both of you must meet the eligibility requirements above. If you agree to be in the study, we will talk to each of you separately for approximately 30 minutes each, then we will talk to you together for 15–30 minutes.

#### What will happen if I say “Yes, I want to be in this research study”?
If you agree to be in this study, we will first collect some basic information about yourself and your computer usage. We will then discuss with you your experiences regarding computer security. We will record the audio of the interview.

#### What happens if I say “No, I do not want to be in this research study”?
Being in this study is up to you. You can say no now or leave the study later. Either way, your decision won't affect your relationship with the researchers or the University of Tennessee.

#### What happens if I say “Yes” but change my mind later?
Even if you decide to be in the study now, you can change your mind and stop at any time:
- If you choose to stop before the interview, simply use the confirmation email sent to you to cancel your interview time.
- If you decide to stop at any time during the interview, let the interviewer know. We will destroy any collected data.
- After the interview is complete, we cannot destroy your data as we will not store any data linking you to your answers.

#### Are there any possible risks to me?
It is possible that someone could find out you were in this study or see your study information, but we believe this risk is small because of the procedures we use to protect your information. These procedures are described later in this form.

#### Are there any benefits to being in this research study?
We do not expect you to benefit from being in this study. Your participation may help us to learn more about how to help immigrants acclimate to computer security in the US. We hope the knowledge gained from this study will benefit others in the future.

#### Who can see or use the information collected for this research study?
We will protect the confidentiality of your information by not associating your name with your responses. If information from this study is published or presented at scientific meetings, your name and other personal information will not be used.

We will make every effort to prevent anyone who is not on the research team from knowing that you gave us information or what information came from you. Although it is unlikely, there are times when others may need to see the information we collect about you. These include:
- People at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, or Brigham Young University who oversee research to make sure it is conducted properly.
- Government agencies (such as the Office for Human Research Protections in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services), and others responsible for watching over the safety, effectiveness, and conduct of the research.
- If a law or court requires us to share the information, we would have to follow that law or final court ruling.
- Business offices at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville may be given your email to issue your payment and report tax information.

Finally, we will use Otter.ai to transcribe the interviews. According to their Terms of Service, your data may be used “for testing, tuning, optimizing, validating, or otherwise enhancing the analytics, models, or algorithms underlying the Service.”

#### What will happen to my information after this study is over?
We will not keep your personal information to use for future research. Your name and other information that can directly identify you will be deleted from your research data collected as part of the study. We may share your research data with other researchers without asking for your consent again, but it will not contain information that could directly identify you.

#### Will I be paid for being in this research study?
- If you are an individual participant, you will be given a $50 Amazon gift card for completing this study. To receive compensation, you will need to provide your email address. Following this, you will receive an email with a link to the gift card.
- If you participate as part of a parent-child pair, you and your parent/child will each be given a $75 Amazon gift card for completing this study. To receive compensation, you will need to provide your email address. Following this, you will receive an email with a link to the gift card.
